            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN all Ages there has been War, and according to the manner of making it, the Rules and Maxims thereof have heen changed: thoſe that are in uſe at preſent are different from what was in practice in former Ages, and all the Authors that have treated of that ſubject, are
<pb facs="tcp:53398:3"/>almoſt of no uſe at all. You have here a ſhort inſtruction of the manner how it is made at preſent, according as I have ſeen it practiſed in theſe laſt Campagnes, which I preſent to all the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who have alwayes reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it their honour to carry Arms for the King, and the glory of their Country: if they who begin that glorious profeſſion can learn any thing thereby, I ſhall think my time and pains very wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THey who beſt underſtand the Art of War, know that the way which the <hi>French</hi> take at preſent, is in very many things different from the practice of other Nations, and eſpecially of <hi>England;</hi> particularly in the Names and Offices of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of an Army, and the way of Training and Exerciſing of Souldiers. The deſigne of the Tranſlator then being to give in <hi>Engliſh</hi> the Art of War
<pb facs="tcp:53398:4"/>as it is now practiſed in <hi>France,</hi> which an expert and induſtrious Gentleman of that Country thought fit to obſerve, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt into a Book Dedicated to the King; he hopes that thoſe who underſtand the Military Art, will not take it amiſs if they meet with ſeveral Names, and Words of Command which are not truly <hi>Engliſh;</hi> his purpoſe being to Tranſlate intelligibly what the <hi>French</hi> obſerve, and not to inſtruct the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their own Trade. For that end, that he might not ſtep <hi>ul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:53398:4"/>they thought fit ſhould be turned as near to the <hi>French</hi> Idiom and Way, as poſſibly could be done, without rendring them obſcure or inſignificant to the intelligent Reader.</p>
            <p>The more difficult terms of Fortification and War, which are for the moſt part originally <hi>French,</hi> are found explained at the end of the Book; and if at this time the Gentlemen and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who may have occaſion to ſerve their own or any other Prince in the illuſtrious Trade of War, may by this ſmall labour reap any advantage, the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hath the ſame kindneſs for his Country, that the Author has for his; not to think his time and pains ill beſtowed.</p>

The Brigads of Horſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain twelve Squadrons a piece; and the Squadrons a hundred and fifty Troopers. The Foot for the moſt part conſiſt of five thouſand men, that is to ſay of ſix Battallions.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE General is to an Army what the ſoul is to the body: and as nothing acts in this but by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul; ſo alſo that great number of Regiments ought to do nothing but by orders from their head. And therefore that charge requires not only a perſon who is brave and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, but alſo who by birth, conduct, liberality, and civility has rendered himſelf conſpicuous. His Valour makes him terrible to his Enemies; and his Experience begets ſo great confidence in his ſouldiers, that they ſeem almoſt aſſured of Victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fight: but his Birth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes his Authority and the reſpect that is due to him; his Conduct pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his men and renders them victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; his Liberality procures him friends and favourers, and by his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility he gains the hearts of his Officers and Souldiers.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53398:11"/>
                  <p>On the prudence of the General de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the ſafety of the Army; and in my opinion that quality is more neceſſary to him, than courage. The bravery of Leaders wanting conduct, has ſometime reduced things to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. And therefore he to whom a Soveraign hath intruſted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of an Army, ſhould well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt his meaſures, before he go into the Field: that is to ſay, place his Magazins in the moſt commodious places; take good information of the Country which he intends for the ſeat of the War; not to advance therein ſo far with his Troops, but that he know how to make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and by what means to make them ſubſiſt; and above all things to poſt himſelf ſo advantageouſly that he may always be maſter of giving or avoiding Battel. Before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any thing, he ſhould always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the chief Officers of his Army, but never acquaint any with his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to conſider well his occaſion in giving Battel, and not to hazard all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53398:11"/>his Forces in the fight, endeavouring to overcome his enemy aſmuch by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry as by force; as in ſurpriſing him in diſorder, his ſouldiers ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, weary, wet, ſtarved with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, cold, or any other bad accident.</p>
                  <p>He ſhould the rather addict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to liberality, that we have ſeveral examples of affairs ruined and Troops diſcomfited, by the ſole avarice of Generals who withheld the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pay, cut off one half of what was neceſſary, and were at no expence in entertaining Penſioners and Spies. The reward that is given to them is of ſo great conſequence, that without that a General can never know any thing of the deſigns of his Enemies; he will remain ſtill ignorant of their force, and ſhall never have account of their enterpriſes; in a word, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie is of no uſe in War but in husbanding the lives of ſouldiers.</p>
                  <p>It ought to be the chiefeſt care of a General to procure the love of all men, and eſpecially of his Officers; that is to be done by treating them civilly,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53398:12"/>hearing their reaſons, praiſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compencing good actions, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bad. A General never ſucceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> well if he have drawn upon himſelf the averſion of his Army, by rugged, haſty and fantaſtical carriages; and if that be his humour, he may very well ſay that he has two Enemies to deal with.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vicecount</hi> of <hi>Turen</hi> had this advantage, that he had acquired the univerſal love of his Souldiers; and there was not an Officer nor Souldier in his Army, who would not with all his heart have ſacrificed himſelf for him: and it may be ſaid that his mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and civil way of carriage, have contributed to his conqueſts as much at leaſt as his courage.</p>
                  <p>But yet a General ſhould not be ſo mild and civil, as not to be rigorous when need requires, and cauſe his Orders moſt ſeverely to be obeyed; otherwayes Military diſcipline would become licentious: and therefore he ſhould diſ-charge his ſouldiers to disband and leave their ranks, to go
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53398:12"/>plunder in a friends Country, nor yet in an Enemies without permiſſion; cauſing ſuch as treſpaſs to be ſeverely puniſhed; and obliging the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to look to it under the pain of being called to an account for their neglect.</p>
                  <p>The duty of a General is to order the March of the Army, and the place of Camping; to viſit the Guards; ſend continually out Parties to skirmiſh, that they may bring him news of the Enemy; to give eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evening the word to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generals, Mareſchals de Camp, Major General, and appoint what is to be done in the night time, or next day. On the day of battel he is to ſeize on the moſt advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous poſt, chuſe his ground, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his battel; he is to poſt his Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; command the Baggage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and ſend off his detachments. At the Siege of a Town, Fort, or Caſtle, he is to order the inveſtiture to be made, mark the Camps, the lines of circumvallation and contraval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53398:13"/>he is to view the place, and cauſe it to be attacked where he hath obſerved it to be weakeſt, he is to viſit the works, hinder any relief to enter, and provide that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys may arrive with all imaginable ſecurity. In a word, the Office of General is of a large extent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a moſt ſtrict care, becauſe on him does a Soveraign repoſe the care of all his Army.</p>
                  <p>The King allows the General a certain number of <hi>Aids de Camp</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </head>
                  <p>AS the General is the ſoul to the body of an Army, ſo the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generals are its noble parts, and theſe being Offices of greateſt importance, require perſons, whoſe courage, capacity and fidelity have been rendred conſpicuous by ſignal ſervices. They ought not only be capable of their own charges; but likewiſe of that of the General, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it happens often that they are entruſted with the command of ſome Camps volans or Flying Armies, yea and with ſome bodies of the Army which they command with an equal Authority to his.</p>
                  <p>The number of Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals is not limited; they are more or leſs, according as the Armies are great or ſmall. When there are ſeveral in one and the ſame Army, they have every one of them their day of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53398:14"/>For example, in a ſiege, there is one Lieutenant General who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Attacque of the place, and who continues in the Trenches twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours, he is called the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General for the day; the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours being over, he that is to come next takes his place, and ſo do the reſt ſucceſſively.</p>
                  <p>The duty of their charge, is to do all that is commanded them by the General, who aſſigns to every one of them Quarters to Command in, and employs them as occaſion requires: ſome to lead a body of Horſe, others to march at the head of Foot, ſometimes for a Convoy, ſometimes for the Van or Reere guards, and ſometimes for Camps Volans. They ought not to fail of being every day with the General, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Orders, and afterward give them out in the Quarters and Poſts that are entruſted to them, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful to give him inceſſantly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all that paſſes there. For that as well as for other occaſions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53398:14"/>the King allows them <hi>Aides de Camp</hi> or Adjutants, and Horſe Guards.</p>
                  <p>Every Lieutenant General has daily at his door a Foot Guard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a Lieutenant, a Serjeant and thirty Souldiers.</p>

               <div n="4" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Mareſchals de Camp.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE charge of Mareſchal de Camp being of no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, nor the leaſt painful of the Army, he that diſcharges it ought to be brave, judicious and expert, that he may remedy many accidental things. There are more or fewer of them created, according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Army, and they ſucceed to one another as the Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals do: when two Attacques are to be made in the ſiege of a place, the Lieutenant General for the day, commands that on the right hand;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53398:15"/>and the Mareſchal de Camp the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the left.</p>
                  <p>The chief duty of that charge is to go daily and receive orders from the General. Upon the march of an Army, he that is for the day, goes the evening before they move with the Quarter-maſter, to receive orders for the way and Encamping. He ought to know the Paſſes, that he may be aſſured what way is beſt for the Troops to march: for that effect he is to give notice the evening to the Squadron that is to mount the Guard for the night following, to be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs againſt next morning before break of day; with whom he is to march, and the Quarter maſters of all the Regiments, of the Artillery and Proviſions are to wait upon him, that they may go and mark out the Camp in the place appointed. In his march he is to ſend ſome Scouts before and on each ſide, to beat the rode: and if there happen an Alarm, he is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf of the nature of it, and ſend intelligence to the General, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53398:15"/>he may receive aſſiſtance, and that the Army may have time to draw up. Being come to the place of Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having choſen the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

To be perfect in that charge, he ought to be like to the <hi>Sieur de Chanlay</hi> who is at preſent Quarter-maſter to the Kings Army; who though he be but ſtill young, yet to his praiſe it may be ſaid, that fourty years ſervice could not make him either more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53398:21"/>or of greater experience than he is.</p>
                  <p>The Quarter-maſter General ſhould go daily and receive orders from the General, know of him the way the Army muſt March; and go to the place of Encamping with the Mareſchal de Camp for the day, where being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived he ſets out the Ground, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it among the Quarter maſters of the ſeveral Regiments; he chuſes a place for the Kings Quarters, there he marks out the Lodgings of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral perſons, and of thoſe who ought to lodge there, he aſſigns a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious place for the Pack of Artillery, another for the Proviſions, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points a place for the Hoſpital, in ſuch a manner that all the Quarters be near the Army and covered by it.</p>
                  <p>Upon a March he is to give the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral an account of the Paſſes and narrow Lanes, to the end that if they meet with any that are troubleſome, he might have time to remedy that by ſending Pioneers to clear the waies.</p>

                  <p>INgeneers are very neceſſary as well for Attacking as defending of places. But the chiefeſt care that is to be taken, is to chuſe ſuch as are not only skilful, but who are as brave as knowing; the meaning is, that theſe imployments require expert and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted men.</p>
                  <p>When the Ingeneers have view'd the place that is to be Attacked, they make their report of it to the General, and tell him the part which they think weakeſt; and to which approaches may be moſt eaſily made. When an Attacque is reſolved, it is their duty to mark out the Trenches, the places of Armes, the Galleries, the Lodgings on the Counterſcarp and Half-moon, and to bring on the Works juſt to the Walls, by the favour of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot; ſetting out to the workmen that are appointed them, the Works that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53398:22"/>they are to finiſh in one night. I have ſaid that they ought to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced and undaunted men, becauſe all that cannot be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great danger to their perſons. And beſides an Ingeneer who is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or fearful, many times does but little mind his buſineſs, and makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled works which muſt be begun a new again with the loſs of many men.</p>
                  <p>They ought to take orders from the General or the Lieutenant General for the day, about what is to be done in the Trenches: give them a faithful account of all; demand a ſufficient number of Labourers, and inſtruments, provide every thing that may be needful to them, and ſecure them at the Reer of the Trenches, or in a place appointed for that end. As Faggots, Pick-axes, Gabions, Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, Spades, Hatchets, Sacks full of Earth, Planks, Tuns, Joiſts, and many other things which cannot be wanting in an Attack. It is their part alſo to mark out the lines of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53398:22"/>with Redoubts and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of fit diſtances.</p>
                  <p>There are more or fewer Ingeneers, according as there is need of them; commanded by a Chief, ſuch as is at preſent the Sieur <hi>de Vauban,</hi> Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal de Camp, and Governour of the Citadel <hi>de L'iſle,</hi> and who has given ſufficient marks of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and skill on many occaſions, not only in the Attacking of places in <hi>Holland, Flanders,</hi> and the <hi>Franch Comte,</hi> but likewiſe in the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Towns and Citadels in <hi>France,</hi> which his Art hath rendred impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and put in a condition not to fear any attempts.</p>

                  <p>It ought to be his firſt care ſo ſoon as he comes to the place of Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to demand ſome Troopers from the Mareſchal de Camp, with whom he may go and ſummon in the Kings name the Caſtles and Forts of the Neighbouring Villages, inſtantly to deliver him a ſufficient number of Guides, which the Communalty muſt furniſh: and when they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him, he is to tie them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for fear they make their eſcape, and bring them into the Kings Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where he muſt have a care to lodge them under Guard.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53398:27"/>for bringing one dayes Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; one third part to go fetch them from the Towns where the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes are kept; another to come with them, and the third to diſtribute and unload them. There is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added to the Proviſions of one day a fourth part of Bread more than is neceſſary. The General ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer theſe Carriages to March without a very ſtrong Guard, that they may arrive with all ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>The Commiſſary General of the Proviſions receives orders from the General for the March of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys, and the places of his Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: he hath private Commiſſaries under him, who are alwayes with the Convoys of the Waggons, and keep a punctual account of the Proviſions which they deliver to the Majors or Aide-majors of the Regiments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a Copy of the Muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roles of the Commiſſaries of War.</p>

                  <p>THE Artillery is a Proviſion of all Armes and Inſtruments that are neceſſary for War, ſuch as are Canons and their Carriages, Bullets, Bombs, Morter pieces, Petards, Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's, Cartridges, Barrels of Pouder, Ball and Match, Sauciſſons, red hot Bullets, Godrons, pitched Faggots ſtuffed with Granado's, all kinds of Arms, Hatchets, Sawes, Shovels, Pick-Axes, Wedges, Ladders of wood and ropes, Beams, Joyſts, Planks, Tuns or Hogſheads, Ropes, Pontons or Boats for Bridges, and all ſorts of Artificial Fire: all theſe things are not drawn after an Army without a great many Carriages, horſes and men appointed for the conduct of that Train. The place where it is Encamped is commonly called the Park of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, where there is a foot Guard ſet, at more than thirty paces diſtance
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53398:28"/>from it, and the Sentinels ſtand there, only with a Pick or Halbard, it being moſt expreſly enjoyned them, to ſuffer no man whoſoever to approach with lighted Matches or Pipes of Tobaco, by reaſon of the Accidents that have been many times occaſioned thereby.</p>
                  <p>The Artillery has at preſent for its Guard and ſervice a Regiment of Fire-locks conſiſting of two Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, under the Command of the great Maſter or General of Artillery, whereof the four firſt companies are made up of Carpenters, Cartwrights, Joyners, Smiths, Lock-ſmiths, Hatchet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Quarry-men and Miners.</p>
                  <div type="section">

                     <p>The chief charge, is that of great Maſter, or General of Artillery, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Duke of <hi>Lude,</hi> he hath an abſolute power over all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and his Officers own none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him but the King and General: and ſerving in Quality of Lieutenant
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53398:29"/>General of the Army, he keeps and account and inventory of all the Pieces, Powder, Bullets, the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of Pieces, and of all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Artillery in the Kingdom, whoſe capacity he ought to know, that he may be ready to inform the King thereof, when his Majeſty has any deſign to be put in Execution, as the beſieging of a place, giving of Battel, and Fortifying of Fronteer Towns. He ought to know what Proviſions and preparations muſt be made; how and in what places the Pieces ſhould be planted, how far they can carry, of what nature is the wall wherein a breach is intended to be made, and what is the force of his Artillery.</p>
                     <p>In the Situation of places he ſhould have a care that the ſeat of his Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery be commodious and eaſy to be defended by the Souldiers; that in caſe of neceſſity the Pieces may be eaſily drawn off; that they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, command, ſhoot ſtreight and level, and that they be not too far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from one another.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:53398:29"/>
                     <p>The great Maſter preſents yearly to the King the Account or Liſt of the Officers of the Artillery, he fills up the empty places with the names of ſuch as he thinks fit; afterward the King confirms or alters them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; ſigns the Roll and cauſes it be ſubſigned by a Secretary of State. That Liſt is delivered up to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer General, who fulfils the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and payes the Officers therein contained. The Officers are four, a Lieutenant General, a Store-keeper General, two Controllers General, one Treaſurer General, who payes out mony according to the Orders of the great Maſter, a Quarter-maſter, and a Provoſt Mareſchal, with Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, Store-keepers, Gunners and Saltpeter-men who ſerve as well in the Army, as in the Towns, Arſenals, and publick work-houſes of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great Maſter receives orders from no Officer but the General, and gives them out in his Park. The Bells of the Towns that are taken by Aſſault or Compoſition belong to the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53398:30"/>and the great Maſter ſends Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to make inventory of what is found in the Magazines.</p>

                  <p>IT is the Generals prudence to order the March of his Army, according to the commodiouſneſs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the knowledge he hath of the Enemies Forces.</p>
                  <p>A great Army marches commonly in three great bodies, the Artillery and Baggage in the middle: but the Country muſt not be traverſed with Mariſhes or Rivulets, and there muſt be an eaſy communication between one body and another. If the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be on the right hand, and the left covered by a River, the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page ſhould march on the ſide of the River, and the Army in a body or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53398:32"/>two on the ſide of the Enemy, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes Detachments of Horſe or Dragoons in the Van-guard and on the Wings.</p>
                  <p>When an Army hath long narrow paſſages of Woods or Mountains to paſs through, the General ſends of immediately ſome Regiments of Foot, and lines his Squadrons with Battalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leaving Foot in the Woods or on the heights to facilitate the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Artillery and Equipage; and as his Troops get through he draws them up in Battel array, and keeps them ſo until all the Army have paſſed the Paſs.</p>
                  <p>When an Army Marches in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where there is no fear of any powerful Army, and where the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral would have them live more at their eaſe; he divides them into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bodies, which he ſends by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wayes, under the Command of General perſons, appointing to all of them a general Rendezvous.</p>
                  <p>The Army in a March is divided into the Van-guard, the body of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53398:32"/>Battel, and the Reer-guard; the Van and Reer-guards are Commanded by Lieutenant Generals and Mareſchals de Camp; the General abides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the body of the Army, from whence he ſends his Orders to all places where there is need of them, by his Aides de Camp or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>WHen a General intends to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege a place, he cauſes it firſt to be inveſted by a Body of Horſe, under the Command of a Lieutenant General, and a Mareſchal de Camp, to hinder all ſuccours from entering it, whileſt he himſelf is expected with the reſt of the Army.</p>
                  <p>The manner of Encamping at a Siege is quite different from that of a March. Here the Army ought to Environ the place in ſuch a manner that nothing can enter it, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring as much as may be to keep the Camps without Cannon-ſhot.</p>
                  <p>If the place ſtand upon a River,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53398:39"/>there is a Detachment made of one part of the Army which takes its Quarters on the other ſide with Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of communication, where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts are made wherein are placed ſtrong Foot-guards. If it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with hills, the heights are to be poſſeſſed from which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might extreamly incommode the Beſiegers, if they are once become Maſters of them.</p>
                  <p>In a Siege the Army Encamps with their back to the place, the Battalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lined with Squadrons. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneers mark out the lines of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation and Contravallation with Redoubts, and Angles in fit diſtances; and every Regiment works at them in the place of its Quarter. The line of Circumvallation is that which is beyond the Camps deſigned only to hinder any relief to enter. The line of Contrevallation is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen the Camps and the place, which cures the Beſiegers from Sallies.</p>
                  <p>When the General hath ordered his Camps, placed his Guards as well
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53398:39"/>on the ſide of the place, as of the Country about, and that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Lieutenant Generals to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in each Quarter, with orders what to do; he goes with his Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers to view the place, and orders the Attaque to be made at the part which he thinks to be weakeſt: for that end he commands the firſt Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot to be in readineſs in more or leſs number according to the ſtrength of the Beſieged, that he may open the Trenches; and orders as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Squadrons as he thinks convenient to mount the Guard of them, and to beat back the Sallies of the Enemies; the Regiments which are to open the Trenches make their Detachments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they draw out of their Camps; they furniſh the number of Labourers that the Ingeneers have required, with Officers to lead them: and the time of marching out drawing near, the Majors draw up the Battallions, the Chaplains make the accuſtomed Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with a ſhort exhortation, at the end whereof they give a general Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53398:40"/>and the Souldiers cry, <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> throwing their Hats in the Air.</p>
                  <p>The Regiments draw off in good order, Drums beating, the Officers with Pikes in hand, the party De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached at their front; and come to the place of working, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Orders what to do from the Lieutenant General for the day, or the <hi>Mareſchal de Camp.</hi> So ſoon as day ends, all the Cavalry of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, except thoſe who have the Guard, go and bring Faggots to the Reer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Trenches; they who are appointed to defend the Labourers, lay themſelves on their Bellies ſome paces beyond the Counterſcarpe, and part of the Souldiers commanded to work, begin to dig and caſt up the earth, according as it hath been mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to them by the Ingeneers, whilſt the others bring them Faggots and Mattocks.</p>
                  <p>The Trenches ought to be ſix foot and a half high, and four broad, with <hi>Banquets</hi> for the convenience of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53398:40"/>Musketeers; and the Ingeneers ſhould carry them on in ſuch a manner that they be not open to the place: when it cannot be otherwayes, that part which is open is covered with great Faggots or Planks of wood called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When two Attacks are made, the firſt Regiment hath the right, and the ſecond the left.</p>
                  <p>The great Maſter or General of the Artillery carries on the works at the Batteries, and brings thither the Cannon, with a ſufficient Proviſion of all that can be uſeful to the Trenches.</p>
                  <p>If there be no <hi>Rideaw,</hi> Shelter, nor Bottom or Depth at the Reer of the Trenches to cover the Horſe-guard; there are Earthen works (called <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paulments</hi>) caſt up, which muſt be Cannon proof, behind which they place themſelves.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as day breaks, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General cauſes all the men draw back within the lines of approaches called the <hi>Boyau,</hi> where every one betakes himſelf to his Poſt that they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53398:41"/>may inceſſantly fire againſt the place; whileſt the Pieces of Battery do all they can to diſmount the Enemies Guns, and ſpoil their works.</p>
                  <p>All the Guards of the Trenches are relieved at the end of twenty four hours, at the ſame hour that they were mounted; and the Regiments that enter the Guard ſhould continue the works as far as the Paliſſadoe.

                  <p>If the Commander of a place be a Lieutenant General, he is to have a Guard at his door, conſiſting of a

                  <p>When the Princes of blood, the Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> and the Generals of an Army paſs through any Town, the Governours furniſh them with a Foot-guard, and at their entry and departure ſalute them with ſome Volleys of Cannon.</p>

                  <p>The Charge of a Colonel requires a Perſon of Quality that is rich, and who commands his Captains abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And that his Regiment may be good and well entertained, he is to oblige them to take care of their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53398:62"/>Companies, and to make choice of good inferior Officers.</p>
                  <p>His duty is to lead his Regiment whitherſoever he is commanded, and to march at the head of it, with a <hi>Hauſſecol</hi> or Gorget, and a Pike in hand. When he is in a Battel his Poſt is with the Pikes, three paces before the Captains. He ought to ſee in what condition his Companies are, and have them filled with good men well armed and accoutered with all that is neceſſary. And as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that makes a Soldier ſo active and dexterous as exerciſing; he ſhould command his officers to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Companies an hour every day, and the Major the Regiment twice a week.</p>
                  <p>When the Regiment marches alone in an Enemies Country, he ſhould as much as poſſibly he can, avoid Plains, and ſeek out covered ways, forbidding his Soldiers upon pain of death to quit their Ranks. He is to order one half of the Captains to march on the Front, and the other at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53398:63"/>the Rear, the Lieutenants and Sub-Lieutenants in the Diviſions, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants on the Wings, a Lieutenant with thirty men in the Van-Guard, and another with the like number for the Rear-Guard. When he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Plain, and cannot avoid it, he is to fraiſe his Battalion; that is, to encompaſs the Muſquetteers with Pikes, that he may defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the Horſe that might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him. The only means to make the Soldiers aſſiduous in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and prevent Licentiouſneſs, is to commaed all the Officers to abide by their Poſts, and to make every Lieutenant reſponſable for his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>In the Siege of a place, the day that his Regiment is in the Trenches, he is to make a prohibition to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers not to go out of the Camp: and having made his Detachments, he is to lead his Regiment to the place of Attack under as good a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert as poſſible he can; where he is to receive Orders from the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53398:63"/>General, or the Marſhal de Camp for the day: afterward he is to relieve the Poſts, viſit the Works, cauſe the Orders that have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to be punctually put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and take care of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Officers; aſſiſting them with all his power, and rendring juſtice to every one without emulation.</p>

The duties of his Charge are like thoſe of the Colonel, who ought never to undertake any thing without conſulting him.

                  <p>The Poſt of a Lieutenant-Colonel is on the left hand of the Colonel, three ſteps before the Captains, when the Regiment conſiſts but of one Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion: but when it is of more, the Colonel commands the firſt, and he the ſecond.

                  <p>THe Charge of Sergeant-Major is another thing in Foot than what it is in Horſe, though the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be not much different. A Major of Horſe is always the firſt Captain of his Regiment, and commands it in abſence of the Maſter de Camp; but the Major of Foot has no Company, and can pretend to no Command but after all the Captains, unleſs he have a particular Commiſſion for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>It is the Major's duty to go every evening, and receive the Word from him that commands; and being in an Army, from the Major-General,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53398:66"/>or Majors of Brigades: afterward to carry it to the Camp to his Colonel, and to aſſemble the Serjeants of the Companies into a circle, that he may give it about amongſt them. If there be any Detachments for Convoys, Guards and Parties; he is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand every Company to have in readineſs the number of Soldiers that have been demanded of him. He is to give notice to Officers, whoſe turn it is to march; and ſhall appoint them an hour and place of Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, where he is to be firſt, that he may receive them, and lead them whither need ſhall require. It is his part to give the Order how and what hour the Companies ſhould march; and if his Regiment muſt be in the Van Guard, Main Battel, or Rear-Guard. Being ready to depart, he is to command the Drummers to beat the Troop, he is to advertiſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains, cauſe the Colours be brought out, draw up the Battalion, and is to give every Officer the Poſt that he muſt keep that day. And having
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53398:66"/>drawn out all his Companies, he is to ſee them depart, that he may know if they march in good order: Before the Regiment come to Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he ought to go and viſit it, then return and draw them up, detach his Courts of Guard, give order to the Serjeants of what they are to do, and order the Companies to go to Quarters. If the Regiment encamp in the Body of an Army, he is to give each Company the Ground that hath been marked out to him, and make them place their Arms in form of a Pyramid, the Pikes apart from the Muskets, ſix large paces before the Huts; he ſhall poſt the Guard of the Camp about fifteen paces beyond the Battalion, and detach the other Guards which the Regiment ſhall be obliged to furniſh. If the Regiment lodge by it ſelf in a Quarter where there is danger, he is to barricade, entrench, or encloſe it with Carts and Waggons; afterward he is to place his Guards about the Quarters, and the Sentinels ſo near together
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53398:67"/>that they may hear one another ſpeak: and is to ſet without the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments Sentinels, <hi>Perdues,</hi> who in caſe of an Alarm, having fired, are to retreat to the Court of Guard. When an Alarm is given to the Camp, the Major muſt come to the place of Arms of the Regiment, form his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion, ſend to double his Guards in the place where the Alarm is given, give notice to his Colonel, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the General with what occurs. No Company ſhould enter or come out of its Poſt without leave from the Major, and no Order is ever altered but by him, becauſe it is always gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the appointment of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or his own Colonel,</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever Ammunition is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Regiment, is delivered to the Major, who divides it among the Companies, and he hath the charge of providing all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; as of ſending the Sick to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals, commanding the Provoſts Marſhal to furniſh Waggons.</p>
                  <p>At the Attack of a place it is his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53398:67"/>duty to give notice to the Regiment of the day when it is to mount the Guard of the Trenches, to cauſe the Drums beat, to command the Officers according to their rank to ſend off Labourers, and Men to defend them. Being come to the Attack, he is to relieve the Poſts, take Orders from the Lieutenant-General, or Marſhal de Camp, what the Regiment is to do; go to the Artillery, and ſee the Inſtruments and neceſſary Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on delivered out, lead the Labourers to the appointed places, and give his Colonel an account of all that paſſes.</p>
                  <p>In day of Battel, he is not to be on Foot in the Rank of the Captains; but on Horſe-back, ſometime on the Front, and ſometime on the Rear, to give the Command, and execute the Orders of his Colonel.</p>
                  <p>The Major is to keep a Roll of the Rank of the Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, muſt know the number of their Soldiers according as they have paſt Muſter, and exerciſe all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments twice a Week, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53398:68"/>the Officers; teaching them the way to ſalute gracefully with the Pike.</p>
                  <p>It is his right to make an Invento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Moveables and Equipage of the Officers of the Regiment that die, and to ſell them at auction by beat of Drum: His dues are the Sword, the Pike, the Corſelet or Gorget, and a ſhilling in the pound of the ſale of their Moveables. He is preſent at the Council of War, and gives his concluſions to the Proceſs, after the ſame manner as the King's Proctor.</p>
                  <p>The Functions of the Aid-Majors are nothing different from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors; and their name explains their charge. The Regiments of Foot have as many Aid-Majors as they have Battalions.</p>

                  <p>THe Infantry hath in all times been the School of War, and they that have been deſirous to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect themſelves therein, have always begun that way. It is far more grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a young Gentleman to carry a Musket, than to ſerve on Horſe; great Lords have ſhewen us the way. The Marqueſs of <hi>Humiers,</hi> Son to the Marſhal, began; Firſt, Enſign-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of the King's Regiment, and is now a Captain in it. The Marqueſs of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xel,</hi> Colonel of the Dolphin's Regiment, hath ſerved as a Captain in the ſame Regiment. The Marqueſs of <hi>Feuquiers,</hi> Colonel of a Regiment of Foot; the Marqueſs of <hi>Crevam,</hi> Colonel of the Queen's Regiment; and the Marqueſs of <hi>Neſle</hi> Colonel of the Regiment of Monſieur the Prince, have ſerved as Lieutenants and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains in his Majeſty's Regiment.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53398:69"/>The Count of <hi>Bourlemont,</hi> Colonel of the Regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Captain in the King's: the Son of the Duke of <hi>Geſvres</hi> is Enſign Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of it ſtill. The Marqueſs of <hi>Genlis</hi> is Colonel of the Crown Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having firſt been a Captain in it; the Marqueſs of <hi>Frowſle</hi> was ſlain at the Battel of <hi>Conſarbrick,</hi> carrying the Enſign Colonel of the Regiment of <hi>Vermandois:</hi> and ſeveral others whom I could name ſtill in actual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Infantry, beſides thoſe whom this profeſſion hath raiſed to greater imployment. I heard <hi>Monſieur de Turenne</hi> ſay, when he was at the ſiege of <hi>Scheinkin-ſcance,</hi> that he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſee the Hollanders defend their places ſo ill, being that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Perſons of Quality ſent their Children to them to learn the Art of War, and that he himſelf did firſt begin to carry a Musket there.</p>
                  <p>It is not enough for a Gentleman, if he would learn ſomewhat, to be at the head of a Company of foot, unleſs he apply himſelf cloſely to his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53398:69"/>employment in the manner following.</p>
                  <p>He ought always have a numerous Company of good and vigorous Souldiers, well kept in Arms and Cloaths, knowing them all by name, and underſtanding what every one of them in particular is capable of: it is no diſhonour to him to go and viſit them often in their Quarters, and to ſee if they be careful to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves neat.</p>
                  <p>A Company every five days has the King's Pay compleat, except a penny which the Captain keeps from them, to furniſh them with Cloaths, Linnen, Shooes and Hats: it is not amiſs if he lend them money himſelf; he thereby obſerves better what they want, and obliges them to keep themſelves neat, and to have a care of their Cloaths: neatneſs is of great advantage to them, and prevents ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſtempers. When there are any ſick or wounded, the Captain ought to ſeparate them from the reſt, and cauſe them be carried to the Hoſpital.</p>
                  <p>The Captain has power in his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53398:70"/>Company to make two Serjeants, three Corporals, and five Lanſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades; but he cannot by his own Authority caſheer them, whatever their fault may be: that depends on a Council of War. He has no power to puniſh a Soldier with death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he rebel; and then he may kill him: but for any thing elſe, he can only impriſon him, and deliver him to the Juſtice that is ſet over the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment.</p>
                  <p>His duty is to lead his Company whitherſoever his Colonel commands him, Marching himſelf on their head, with his Corſelet, and Pike in hand. The Aſſiduity of Captains keeps the Soldiers in Duty: There are ſome now a days, who thinking it a breach of honour to march at the head of their Companies, leave them to be led by their Officers, and make their Lackeys carry their Arms. A good Captain ſhould himſelf order the March of his Company either by two or four; placing the Pikes in the Rear, or in the Centre in form of a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53398:70"/>Battalion, taking his own Poſt at the Head of them, the Lieutenant at the Rear, the Sub-Lieutenant or Enſign at the head of the Pikes, and the Serjeants on the Flanks. And to lead them to the Rendezvous in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with Drums beating.</p>
                  <p>He ſhould exerciſe his Soldiers to uſe their Arms, teach them to put themſelves into Battel-Aray, and to rally again as they were when they are broken, and to inſtruct them in all the motions neceſſary to Foot; to make their Huts or Lodgings in the Camp, and all other Exerciſes of War.</p>
                  <p>At the Siege of a place, when he is in the Trenches, he is to abide in the Poſt that has been entruſted to him, until he be releived; defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it vigorouſly, and making the Soldiers that are committed to him fire continually. When he has the Command of the Labourers, it is his duty to make them haſten to put themſelves quickly under covert, to take heed that none leave their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53398:71"/>Ranks, or lie on their bellies for fear, or that they may not work.</p>
                  <p>In a Garriſon he is to mount the Guard at his turn in the Poſt that ſhall fall to him by lot, and not to leave it until it be relieved; often viſiting and making his Rounds exactly. When he marches with the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Poſt is one day on the Front, and the other on the Rear; never leaving it without his Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel's leave, and taking ſpecial care that no Soldier leave his Rank with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his permiſſion.</p>
                  <p>When he marches with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſingle, he is in a morning to ſend his Lieutenant before to their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, make his Soldiers march all the way in good order; and about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way cauſe them to halt for the ſpace of two hours, hindring them from ſtraggling that they may not go pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in the Villages. A Captain ſhould never be too rough with his Soldiers, nor yet too indulgent; the one makes him hated, and the other ſlighted.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53398:71"/>
                  <p>He muſt know how to make his Men fight ſingly, and in company; be acquainted with the advantages of Places, Arms, Time and Occaſions, that he make uſe of them. He muſt apply himſelf to the knowledge of Fortifications, the manner of attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and defending a place, how and in what manner the Works are to be carried on; to the end, that when it comes to his turn to carry on or defend a Work, he may not commit the eſcape of a Prentice.

                  <p>The duty of a Corporal is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Eſcouade, to teach his Soldiers all that is neceſſary for them to know or do, to hinder Quarrels and Diſorders, and acquaint the Captain with them, becauſe he cannot beat, but only puniſh them by keeping them long at their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel poſt. He is to have a Role of his Eſcouade, tell the Souldiers what day they are to mount the Guard, view their Arms and Bandeleers, give them out the Proviſions and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition which the Sergeant hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him, and to know who are beſt experienced that he may place
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53398:78"/>them Sentinels and ſet them on the moſt important duties. When he is on the Guard, it is his duty to ſet the Sentinels in the places which the Major hath ſhewed him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them himſelf; To ſend Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſades to viſit them, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Rounds and Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tounds, who are to give him the Word: He ought to charge the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels to ſuffer no body to approach them, though it were the General of the Army himſelf, without preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pike, or Musket with a cock'd March; nor to leave their Poſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs relieved by the Corporal, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Enemy, then they may retire to the Court of Guard, and the Court of Guard being forced may retire to the Camp.</p>
                  <p>The Corporal is to cauſe reſpect to be payed to the Court of Guard, and command ſilence whether it be at the Gates or on the Walls, that the noiſe may not hinder the Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Sentinels from being heard. He is to walk before his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53398:78"/>Court of Guard, or appoint a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſade to do it, he is always to keep fire for Lighting the Matches, and take care to have the Court of Guard furniſhed with Wood, Coal, and Candle. In a Gariſon whil'ſt the Drums beat to Guard, all the Corporals go to the Majors Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they may there draw lots for the Poſts and Rounds.</p>
                  <p>Heretofore the Lanſpaſſades were diſmounted Troopers who were made ſerve in the Foot during the Campain, until their Captains gave them other Horfes; they eaſe the Corporals and are as their Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: In times of danger they go the perilous Rounds, and are Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels <hi>Perdues,</hi> otherways they are freed from duty.</p>
                  <p>The Fourier ought to have a Liſt of all the Soldiers of a Company, and make the diſtribution of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. He takes his Quarter from the Regiment Quarter Maſter, then he marks out the Quarters of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Lieutenant, Sublieutenant. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53398:79"/>Sergeants, the Drummer's and his own, and puts all the reſt into Billets, which he makes the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals draw by Lot, who diſtribute them amongſt the Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Every Company ſhould have a Surgeon, commonly called Frater, to dreſs the Sick and Wounded, and ſhave the Souldiers, being as a Mate to the Surgeon Major of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He ought to make Proviſion of Medicaments proper to ſtop Bleeding, hinder Inflammation and eaſe Pains.</p>
                  <p>There is no Company but hath one or two Drummers, and a Drum-Major over all, who hath the care of inſtructing the reſt, and guarding the Enemies Drummers that come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Camp. He can with his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton puniſh thoſe that fail in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and goes Evening and Morning to the Major to receive his Orders. The Drummers duty is to beat all Points, as the General, the Call or Gathering, the Dernier, the March, the Allarm, the Parly, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53398:79"/>to Parleys, the Reveilly, the Tattoe and the Bans.</p>
                  <p>The Soldier ought to be ſtout, ſtrong, a good Huſband, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to all his Officers, from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Lanſpaſſades. He ſhould ſtudy to keep himſelf neat, to make his Arms bright and clean; to know how to uſe them, the Soldier's du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the motions of his Company, its March; to lodge himlelf in the Field, keep his Guard and Sentinel-Poſt, to underſtand the Beat of Drum, and to be diligent to come to his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. His eating and ſleep ſhould be regulated according to his leiſure, and not his pleaſure.</p>

The detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made by Companies that the Fatigue or Loſs which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen may be divided amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Two or three Thouſand men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from an Army, are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Brigadeer, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers proportionably.</p>
                  <p>To Eight hundred men there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a Colonel, a Lieutenant-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53398:94"/>an Aid-Major, ſixteen Captains, as many Lieutenants, as many Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieutenants or Enſigns, and thirty two Serjeants.</p>
                  <p>A Lieutenant Colonel has four or five thouſand men allowed him; with other Officers and Serjeants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably.</p>
                  <p>A Captain never marches in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment without fifty Soldiers, a Lieutenant, a Sublieutenant or an Enſign and two Sergeants.</p>
                  <p>A Lieutenant has but thirty men and one Serjeant. A Sublieutenant Twenty five men and a Sergeant; and the Enſigns march not but with Captains; a Serjeant is uſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out with ten or twelve Men, and ſometimes he is allowed fifteen.</p>
                  <p>The detachments which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mauded by Maſters de Camp conſiſt of three or four hundred Troop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Thoſe of Captains of Light Horſe of fifty, thoſe of Lieutenants of thirty, thoſe of Cornels of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thoſe of Quarter Maſters of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and thoſe of Brigadeers of ten or twelve Troopers.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:53398:95"/>
                  <p>When an Entrenchment is to be forced, a cloſe or covered way carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a Half Moon gained, or an Aſſault to be made; there is a Detachment made out of ſeveral Companies of good Soldiers, who are commonly called the Forlorn Hope, becauſe they ought to fall on firſt, and make a Paſſage for the reſt. An Attacque is always begun by a Sergeant with ten men, ſeconded by a Lieutenant with thirty, backed by a Captain, A Lieutenant, a Sublieutenant or an Enſign with fifty, who are followed by all the Regiment.</p>
                  <p>Detachments of many Officets are always made by the Front and Rear: For inſtance if a Regiment be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to furniſh four Captains, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor ſhall command two from the Front, and two from the Rear: The ſame is obſerved in reſpect of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Sublieutenants and Enſigns.</p>
                  <p>Detachments for the Guard of General Perſons are never made by Brigades, but by every Regiment in particular to which that honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53398:95"/>The firſt Regiment of the Army furniſhes the Generals Guard; the ſecond the Lieutenant Generals, the third that of the General Perſon who comes next, and ſo the reſt in Order.</p>

                  <p>WHen a Regiment is to leave a Quarter, the Major gives notice of it to the Serjeants of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery and gives Orders to the Drummers to beat the Troop or to March next Morning two Hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day, that the Soldiers may have time to make ready.</p>
                  <p>The Regiment Quarter-Maſter goes and receives Orders of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and departs with the Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers or Company-Quarter-Maſters, two or three houers before the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to take up the Quarters in the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53398:96"/>place where the Regiment is to lodge.</p>
                  <p>The Provoſt Marſhal gathers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Baggage and ſends it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before the Regiment, when there is no danger of an Enemy, taking upon himſelf the care of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting it.</p>
                  <p>The Major ought over night to command a Serjeant with ten men to depart next Morning by Break of Day, and Poſt himſelf on the Rode by which the Regiment is to March, to hinder any Soldier from going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt without an Order from his Officer in writing.</p>
                  <p>When all things are diſpoſed and the Major is informed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the hour when the Companies ſhould March, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Drummers to beat the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering or Call.

                  <p>The Drummers march about twenty Paces before the Battalion, with their Drums on their Backs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one that beats, who is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved every League.</p>
                  <p>The Lieutenants and Sublieuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants ſhould have a care that no Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier go out of his Diviſion, unleſs

                  <p>About mid way the Commander ſhall make his Regiment halt for the ſpace of two hours, chuſing for that purpoſe a place were there is Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and at a diſtance from Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <p>When the Regiment is near their Quarters, the Quarter-Maſter who ought already to have lodged the equipage, comes with the Fouriers to meet them, and gives the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel an account of the condition of the Quarters. The Major com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Colours to be diſplayed, and the Matches Lighted, he divides the Drummers, and makes the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enter in good Order into the Quarter as far as the place of Arms, where he draws it up in Battalia: He eſtabliſhes a Court of Guard to hinder diſorders in the Night time, he cauſes the Colours to be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53398:97"/>to the Commanders Quarters, and ſets a Sentinel at his door; he orders next the Serjeants to come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Word at a certain hour in the Evening, and the Drummers to beat the Tattoe; he ſends off a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant to guard the Magazin, where Proviſions are diſtributed; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving provided every thing, he ſends the Companies to the Quarters allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them.

                  <p>THe Council of War of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my meets always at the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's Lodgings or Tent; and none are called to it but the Lieutenant-Generals, the Marſhals de Camp, the Brigadeers, and ſometimes the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels or the Commanders of Bodies,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53398:98"/>when the matters concern their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments.</p>
                  <p>Private Councils of War are held at the Governours Quarters in a place of Garriſon; in a Camp, at the Colonel of the Regiment his Tent, who gives notice to the Captains to be preſent. When all are met, the Governour, or Colonel, or he that Commands, takes his place at the head of the Table, the Captains ſit about according to their Seniority; that is to ſay, the firſt Captain on the right hand of him that preſides, the ſecond on the left, and ſo of the reſt; and the Major, who diſcharges the Office of the King's Proctor or Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſits at the lower end of the Table. The Lieutenants, Sub-Lieutenants and Enſigns have right to enter into the Chamber where the Council is held; but they ſtand at the Captains backs with their hats off, and have no Vote.</p>
                  <p>If the Council be called to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on ſome matter of conſequence; the Preſident having opened it to the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53398:98"/>aſſembly, asks their Opinions.</p>
                  <p>The youngeſt Captain begins and gives his, and the reſt in Order till it come to the Preſident, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces laſt. The Clark having ſet down the opinions of every one, draws up the reſult conform to the pluralitie of Votes, which he gives to be ſigned by the Preſident and Captains.</p>
                  <p>If the Council be held to Judge a Criminal, the Officers that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it ſhould come faſting, and having firſt heard Maſs, if they can; Every one having taken his place; and the Clark having read the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, Reexamination, Confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Interrogatory; The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident cauſes the Criminal to be brought unto the Council, where he makes him ſit down on the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, queſtions him about all the Facts whereof he is accuſed, and ſends him back to Priſon. Then the Clark reads over the concluſions of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, and every one Judges according to his Conſcience and the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53398:99"/>of the King. The Sentence is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med conform to the plurality of Votes, and is pronounced to the Criminal in the name of the Council of War.</p>
                  <p>When the Criminal is condemued to any Puniſhment; the Provoſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal cauſes the Sentence to be put in Execution, and the Major calls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Companies to be Preſent thereat. Before a Soldier be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Executioner to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for any Crime that carries infamy with it, he ought to be publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from his Arms by the Major.</p>
                  <p>The Council of War ſhould never conſiſt of fewer than ſeven Officers: When there are not Captains enough to make up that number the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Officers are called even to the Serjeants.</p>
